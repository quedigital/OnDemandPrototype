<p>It can take you a while to access a file or folder buried several layers down in a folder. To save some time, you can create shortcuts to the items you use frequently. <strong>Aliases</strong> are shortcuts that point to a folder or file. An alias allows you to access the original folder or file from several different places. <img style="float: right; padding: 1rem; width: 50%; min-width: 175px" src="alias-arrow.png"/>When you create an alias to a folder or file, the icon includes a little arrow in the lower-left corner. You can't make an alias for an application. However, you can add an application into the Dock which acts like an alias. When you double-click an alias icon, a folder opens with the contents of the original folder or a document opens using its associated application. If you delete an alias of a folder or file the original folder or file is not deleted, just the alias.</p>
